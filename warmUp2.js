// 1- Using recursion Write a JavaScript program to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive numbers.
function gcd(a, b) {
	function multiply(x, y) {
if (x > y) 
		return x * y; 
}
	return gcd(a) * gcd(b);
}

function loop(x, y) {
	(if x * y * x * y = a) && (x * y * x = b) 
		return x * y;
}
// 2-Write a function called sum that accepts two numbers as parameters, and sum them together but without suming them togther directly

//you can only add one at each summetion, you'll need to use recursion in this.
