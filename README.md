# Warm Ups

## First Warm Up

### Questions

1- Create a third variable called z, assign x + y to it, and display it.

2- calculate the area of a square using varaiables.


## Second Warm Up

### Questions

1- Using recursion Write a JavaScript program to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive numbers.

2- Write a function called sum that accepts two numbers as parameters, and sum them together but without suming them togther directly you can only add one at each summetion, you'll need to use recursion in this.


## Third Warm Up

### Questions

1- Create arrays in the global scope consisting of strings that represent:
- name of females in your class
- name of males in your class
- name of your class instructors 
 
2- Write a function that takes an array as an argument and returns the element that is located in the middle of that array.

3- Change all the numbers in the array to be multiplied by two for even indexes.


## Fourth Warm Up

### Questions

1- Write a function that takes a string as an input and returns the reverse of each letter followed by a number starting from zero(solve it using while loop).
example:    

```javascript
reverseStr('hello'); // "o1l2l3e4h"
```

2- Write a function that takes array of strings and returns an array of the strings that have the same length
example:

```javascript
['hi','hello','welcome','hy'] // ["hi","hy"]
```


## Fifth Warm Up

### Questions

 1- create a data model to represent your classmates:
 - think of different attributes of your classmates? what do all of them have ?
 - create a factory function.
 - create an array to hold the classmates that you created and what you created to it .  
 - write a function called displayFriend that takes a mate as an argument and returns the important information in a readable way.
 - write a function called addFriend that takes a mate as an argument and add it to you classMates arraya.
 - calculate the number of male friends that your class have by writing a function called nbOfMale.
 - Write a function searchMates that, given a query and an array of Mates, searches the array of mates for "matching" mate. You will decide what way you want to write your search algorithm.


## Sixth Warm Up

### Questions

1- implement the function mult that takes a single parameter n, and computes the multiplication of all integers up to n starting from 0, e.g.:

```javascript
mult(3); // => 6
mult(4); // => 24

function mult(n) {
 // your code is here
}
```

2 - Use a while loop to build a single string with the numbers 1 through n separated by the number next to the current number. Have it return the new string.

```javascript
// eg => 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 ...
```


## Seventh Warm Up

### Questions

 1- using ```+``` operator combine your partner first and last name.

 2- find if the number 13 is a multiple of 3 or not.

 3- calculate the average age of the follwing ages ```javascript [13,14,13,15,16,17,19,13,16,15] ```.

 4- calculate your age in seconds.


## Eighth Warm Up

### Questions

1- create a function isSubset that should take two arrays and determine whether the second array is a subset of the first array. For example:

```javascript
			  array: [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ], sub:[ 2, 3, 4 ] => true
              array: [ 2, 2, 2, 3, 4 ], sub:[ 2, 4, 3 ] => true
              array: [ 2, 3, 3, "a" ],  sub:[ 3, 3, 3, "a" ] => false
```
